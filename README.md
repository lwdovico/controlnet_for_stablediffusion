# WARNING: Deprecated

After the migration of colab to python 3.9 it doesn't work anymore, considering now TheLastBen also implemented controlnet in his notebook I suggest using that one: [TheLastBen's repo](https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion)

------------------------------

Colab notebook to easily run the AUTOMATIC1111 web-ui with ControlNet integrated.

Just open the notebook in colab and run it.

Let me know about any bugs.
